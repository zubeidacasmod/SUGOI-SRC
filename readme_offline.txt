Please ensure that the the following is in the folder:

Folder Input Files

and run the Jar file from this folder. Do not move it out of this folder because it has
dependencies on other input files and libraries within this folder.

This offline version of SUGOI! does not support import statements.
If your ontology imports another ontology, please merge the axioms
of both the ontology files into a single ontology making sure there are no
import statements. To do this, use Protege v4.3. Go to the refractor menu,
select Merge ontologies and ensure that the ontology and all its imports 
are selected.Save this to a new file to use in SUGOI! descktop offline version.
